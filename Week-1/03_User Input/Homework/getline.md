`getline` is a C++ standard library function that is used to read a line of text from an input stream, such as `std::cin` (for reading from the console) or a file stream. It is part of the `<string>` header file.

The syntax for using `getline` is:

```cpp
std::getline(input_stream, string_object, delimiter_character);
```

Here's what each part means:

- `input_stream`: This is the input stream from which the line of text will be read. It can be `std::cin` for reading from the console, or a file stream object if reading from a file.
- `string_object`: This is the `std::string` object where the read line of text will be stored.
- `delimiter_character` (optional): This is the character that marks the end of the line. If not provided, it defaults to the newline character `\n`.

The `getline` function reads characters from the input stream and stores them in the `string_object` until it encounters the `delimiter_character` or the end of the input stream. It does not store the `delimiter_character` in the `string_object`.

Here's an example that demonstrates the use of `getline` to read a line of text from the console:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::string name;

    std::cout << "Enter your name: ";
    std::getline(std::cin, name);

    std::cout << "Hello, " << name << "!" << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `getline` is used to read the user's name from the console input (`std::cin`). The read name is stored in the `name` string variable, which is then printed to the console.

One key advantage of using `getline` over the extraction operator `>>` is that `getline` can read lines of text that contain whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, etc.), while `>>` stops reading at the first whitespace character encountered.

`getline` is particularly useful when reading text input from the user or reading lines of text from a file.
